		<h1>Favorite Pokemon</h1>
		<p> This list is base purely on the aesthetic and personal experience with them than stats.</p>

		<h2>Number 3: Pikachu</h2>

		<p>Now this choice is mainly because of my love of the anime as a child. Following Ash journey from complete incompantence to sometimes making smart decision, has made me appreciate the pure utter bullshit that is Ash's Pikachu. Beating legendary like Regigice and Latios? Latias? One of those two. Then somehow losing to a level 5 Snivy, I have to wonder, what is reality? In all Seriousness the design is adorable and even how crap a pikachu actually is, I still love this pokemon.</p>

		<h2>Number 2: Espeon</h2>

		<p>Now this choice is base on one of my two favorite game of the series that actually came out on console. Pokemon Colosseum and Pokemon Gale of Darkness XD. In the first you start with a Espeon and Umbreon and in the second you start with Eevee that can be evolve to an Espeon. The joy of wrecking face with Espeon in these two game had left a soft spot in my heart for the pokemon.</p>

		<h2>Number 1: Greninja</h2>
